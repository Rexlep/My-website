    I'm a UI/UX designer and software developer with a strong focus on building practical, user-centered digital products. My background combines professional interface design with hands-on experience in developing automation systems, Python applications, and Django-based backends.

    Throughout my work, I’ve created multiple real-world projects, including custom desktop applications with CustomTkinter, data-driven tools, and full automation pipelines. I also have experience developing structured dashboards, workflow systems, and smart utilities designed to help businesses improve efficiency.

    Currently, I’m working on a fully professional automation platform, aiming to integrate clean design with robust backend engineering.

    In addition to development, I’m an active instructor. Over the past years, I’ve taught more than 1,000 students, helping them learn Python, UI/UX fundamentals, and real-world software development techniques. My teaching style is practical, direct, and focused on building real skills — not just theory.

    My goal is to continue bridging design and engineering by creating products that are both beautiful and powerful, while mentoring the next generation of developers and designers.
